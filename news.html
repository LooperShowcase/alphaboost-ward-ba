        Elon Musk’s deal for Twitter has features that make it risky, including
        billions of dollars of personal debt. If it goes wrong, it could burn
        Tesla shareholders and strain Twitter’s financial health. There are
        already signs of investor concern. As Tesla has become one of the
        world’s most valuable companies, its stock has become widely owned by
        retail investors through mutual funds and other investment vehicles. But
        it has fallen 24 percent since the disclosure early last month that Mr.
        Musk had taken a sizable stake in Twitter, a period in which the S&P 500
        has declined 10 percent. “Even if he’s able to finance it, it just is
        not a sensible deal from a financial perspective,” said Aswath
        Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of
        Business. Mr. Musk has demonstrated that he can build two large,
        successful companies at once: After some stumbles, Tesla sells far more
        electric vehicles than any competitor, and SpaceX is a leading rocket
        company. And he may be able to make Twitter more popular and profitable.
        But Tesla shareholders are about to find out what happens when a chief
        executive becomes, along with his other duties, overseer of an internet
        battleground.
